# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

lunchmove-env

# Ignore all .pyc files
*.pyc

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
*.log

# Ignore javascript dependencies
static/app/bower_components/*
static/app/node_modules/*

# Ignore .vagrant/ things and other stuff related to local dev env
\.DS_Store
\.vagrant
vagrant.json
*.swp
*.pgbak
Gemfile.lock


# VERY IMPORTANT: ignore setup/private because it has sensitive things in it. we'll have to copy these files around between ourselves manually, preferably with charcoal rubbings or perhaps cuneiform tablets
setup/private/*
